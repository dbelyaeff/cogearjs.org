It means that it compiles `source` folder data to static html and assets files to the `output` folder.\n\nPages in `source` folder can be provided in different formats: `.md`,`.pug`,`.html`,`.ejs`,`.hbs`.\n\nCompiled pages can have `layouts` which are provided by site `theme`.\n\nMain script `app.js` is bundled with every page, but additional per page scripts can be defined in page meta (with [`yaml-front-matter`](https://github.com/spatie/yaml-front-matter)).\n\nAll external (remote) and internal(local or from `node_modules`) modules should be imported from scripts.\n\n# Build\nTo build static site **Cogear.JS** performs next steps:\n1. Reads site config from `./config.json`.\n2. Searches `source` directory `pages` subfolder for pages. (default: `./src/pages`)\n3. Reads pages. \nAvailable page formats: `.md`,`.pug`,`.html`,`.ejs`,`.hbs`.\nParse metadata with [`yaml-front-matter`](https://github.com/spatie/yaml-front-matter).\n4. Compiles static `html` files from pages content through the `theme` layout into `build` folder.\n5. Fires up `webpack` server (in `production` mode) or `webpack-dev-server` (in `dev` mode, with *hot-reload*).\n6. Compiles assets and injects them into previousely built static html files.\nAssets are: `js`,`coffee`,`css`,`sass`,`scss`,`stylus`,`less`,`Vue`,`jsx`,`fonts`,`images`.\n7. Done.\n\n\n\n## Config\nConfig is a simple JSON-file located at `./config.json`.\n```json\n{\n  \"site\": {\n    \"title\": \"Cogear.JS – modern site generator (Node.JS/Webpack)\"\n  },\n  \"theme\": \"default\"\n}\n```\nIf `page` title is not defined then site config title will be used.\n\nPay attention to the `theme` property as it defines basic layout and can be also used to load scripts, styles and other assets.\n\n# Modes\nWhen **Cogear.JS** is called from command line it starts in `production` mode.\n\n## Production\n```bash\n> cogear # run production mode by default\n```\nThis mode performs:\n1. Pages build.\n2. Assets compilation and injection to pages with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).\n3. Starting local server to check out the results.\n\nIt should be called before [deploy](/docs/deploy) process in order output files to be built in physical file system.\n\n## Development\n```bash\n> cogear dev # run dev mode with param\n```\nThis mode peforms:\n1. Pages build and start watcher to listen for pages changes.\n2. Start [`webpack-dev-server`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) which will instantly update in-browser pages, scripts and styles on the fly with `hot-reload` module.\n3. Local server is server by [`webpack-dev-server`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server).\n\nIt handles all files in memory, so there is no output in physical file system in this mode. \n\n\n# Source\nIt's the place where all magic happens.\n\nBasic structure:\n```bash\n# Listing of ./src dir\n./src\n|  layouts/     # optional\n|    index.pug  # optional\n|  pages/       # required\n|    index.md   # site index page\n|  app.js       # required\n```\n\nThe required files are: `app.js` and `pages/index.md` (`Markdown` or [any other format](#pages)).\n\n## Main script `app.js`\n\nIt's the `entry` point ([`Webpack` term](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/)) which has to be injected in all the pages.\n\nAll you internal and external scripts may be imported there.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\n// Look at webpack-specific comments\nimport(/* webpackPrefetch: true*/'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.7.1/css/bulma.min.css')\n// Either remote or local scripts, styles and other resources (like fonts) can be loaded\nimport(/* webpackChunkName: \"styles\", webpackPrefetch: true, webpackPreload: true*/'./css/app.styl')\n// You can even import your theme entry script if it's necessary\nimport('@/theme.js')\n// `@` is an alias for current theme folder\n// `#` is an alias for project root folder\n```\n\n\n\n# Pages\nPages are the main structure units of **Cogear.JS** generator.\n\nThey must be located at `pages` folder of the `source` directory (default: `./src/pages`).\n\n## Formats (parsers)\n\nThey can be in various formats: `.md`,`.pug`,`.html`,`.ejs`,`.hbs`.\n\nDifferent pages can have their own file extension at the same time (but avoid the same filenames).\n```bash\n./src/pages\n|  index.md            # Compiles with Markdown\n|  about.html          # Compiles with EJS (can use variables)\n|  contact-us.pug      # Compiles with PUG\n|  portfolio.ejs       # Compiles with EJS\n|  testimonals.hbs     # Compiles with Handlebars\n```\n\n## Metadata with [`yaml-front-matter`](https://github.com/spatie/yaml-front-matter)\nEach page can store meta-data with the help of [`yaml-front-matter`](https://github.com/spatie/yaml-front-matter) script.\n\nExample:\n`./src/pages/about.md`\n```bash\n---\ntitle: About   # Used for html head title param\nuri: about-us  # Used for generated file path\nlayout: about  # User for layout\n---\n# About us\n\nYou may contact us anytime using this phone number:\n\n## 8-800-000-00-00\n```\n<article class=\"message is-warning\">\n  <div class=\"message-body\">\n    No matter what page format do you use, <a href=\"https://github.com/spatie/yaml-front-matter\"><code>yaml-front-matter</code></a> meta-data <b>should always be formatted in that same way</b>.\n   </div>\n</article>\n\nExample:\n`./src/pages/about.html`\n```bash\n---\ntitle: About   # Used for html head title tag\ndescription: Awesome contacts page # Used for html head meta description tag\nkeywords: cogear.js, node, webpack # Used for html head meta keywords tag\nuri: about-us  # Used for generated file path\nlayout: about  # User for layout\n---\n<h1><%= title%></h1>\n\nYou may contact us anytime using this phone number:\n\n<h2>8-800-000-00-00</h2>\n```\n<article class=\"message is-info\">\n  <div class=\"message-body\">All the metadata is provided as <b>JSON-object</b> to the page template and to the layout template.\n  <br>Pages content is provided via <code>content</code> variable provided for layouts.</div>\n</article>\n\nExample: `./themes/default/layouts/index.pug`\n```pug\ndoctype html\nhead\n  title= title\n  meta(name=\"description\" content=description)\n  meta(name=\"keywords\" content=keywords)\n\tblock head\nbody\n\tblock content\n\t\t!= content // is needed to be unescaped\n\tblock footer\n```\nAs page contents is a simple html **don't forget to unescape it** in page layout.\n\n## Routing\nIf `uri` param is not provided, **Cogear.JS** builds page route corresponding to folders structure.\n\nExample:\n\nSource file | Generated file | Real usage\n:----------:|:-----------:|:------------:\n/index.md    | /index.html  | /\n/contact-us.hbs | /contact-us/index.html | /contact-us/\n/about/index.pug | /about/index.html | /about/\n/portfolio/beautiful-site.ejs | /portfolio/beautiful-site/index.html |  /portfolio/beautiful-site\n\nIn custom case when `uri` is provided system will follow it, adding `/index.html` at the end if is needed:\n\n`uri` param | Generated file | Real usage\n:----------:|:--------------:|:-----------:\nindex.html | /index.html | /\nabout | /about/index.html | /about\nportfolio/awesome-site | /portfolio/awesome-site/index.html | /portfolio/awesome-site\n\nIn most cases you won't needed `uri` param at all.\n\n## Per page scripts\nAll the pages share `app.js` entry script. But what if we need some other script to be on some page?\n\nUser `js` array variable to add scripts relative to site `source` directory (default: `./src`).\n\n<article class=\"message is-warning\">\n  <div class=\"message-body\"><b>Attention!</b> Usage of <code>js</code> meta-variable will rewrite it's default value (<code>app.js</code>). Don't forget to include <code>app.js</code> if you need it.</div>\n</article>\n\nExample: `./pages/about.md`\n```bash\n---\ntitle: About\njs: [\"app.js\",\"js/about.js\"]\n---\n# About page\n```\n\nExample: `./pages/js/about.js`\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"This message is shown only in \\\"About\\\" page console.\")\n// Or you can import even remote scripts\nimport('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.3.3/semantic.min.js')\nimport('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.3.3/semantic.min.css')\n// Or node_modules\nimport Vue from 'vue'\n// Or local scripts\nimport Lib from './lib.js'\nimport './css/about.sass'\n```\n\n## All pages in JSON-file\n\nFor usefull cases after the build has been done (and before `Webpack` starts) all the pages are store in `./src/pages.json` file.\n\nIt can be import in any entry point and used, for example, in menu building or list output.\n\nExample: `./src/app.js`\n```javascript\nimport pages from \"./pages.json\"\n\npages.forEach((page)=>{\n  // Do something\n})\n```\n\n# Layouts\nAfter the `page` content is parsed with proper formatter, system starts up to look for the layout.\n\n`Layout` can be a file of the same [formats](#formats-parsers-).\n\nIf `layout` is not defined in `page` metadata, it will be set to `index` by default.\n\nExample:\n```bash\n---\ntitle: Index\n# no layout is provded here, so it'll be set to `index` by default\n---\n# Page contents\n```\n\nIf `layout` is provided but has no extension, `.pug` will be used by default.\n\nExample:\n```bash\n---\ntitle: Index\nlayout: index # .pug extension will be added by default\n---\n# Page contents\n```\n\nIf `layout` is set to `false`, the `page` output will be written directly to the `output file` (__without layout__).\n\nExample:\n```bash\n---\ntitle: Index\nlayout: false # layout is set to `false`, then page will be written directly to the output file\n---\n# Page contents\n```\n\n## Layouts resolver\nLayouts can be located at current theme `layouts` folder (default: `./themes/default/layouts`) or at current site `layouts` folder (example: `./src/layouts`).\n```bash\nSearch loop:\n1. Site layouts   # (ex.:`./src/layouts`)\n2. Theme layouts  # (ex.:`./themes/default/layouts`)\n```\nThis way you can override theme layout with the current site layout.\n\n## Page content in layout\n\nAs it was said earlier, page metadata and it's content (as `content` field of data object) are provided to layout as variables.\n\nLet's look and `html5` template (which also served with `EJS` compiler to make _variables_ be used):\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<head>\n  <title><%= title%></title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <%- output%>\n</body>\n```\nPay attention that `content` variable must be **unescaped** as it contains raw html data, parsed from page contents.",
